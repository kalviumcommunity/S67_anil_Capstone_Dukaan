frontend-deployment link

I have created Login page.. if a user already have an account they can login using their email id and password  and it will navigate into dashboard page if the email id and password are correct 
after login the token will be generated in backend and it will be sent into frontend.. in frontend it will be stored in local storage. 


i have also created SIGN UP page.. if user doesnt have account they can register themself by creating account by proving details like email, password and name 

i have build all the componet using react and used axios to send data to backend and to fetch it when required it and have used react router dom to navigate between login and dashboard page
